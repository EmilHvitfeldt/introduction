# Advent of Code

## I Did 'Advent of Code' and Here is What I Learned

Many of us like puzzles. Wrestling with simple-to-understand questions, with tricky-to-find-solutions gives you a special type of bliss when you finally crack it. “Advent of Code” has been going for 7 years, challenging over 200,000 people with 25 days of action-packed programming puzzles. Participating in these events taught Emil a lot about himself, his motivations, and his tool of choice, R.

This talk will pull back the curtain on a collective journey of learning. A series of elf-inspired tasks provides a challenge for all ages, skill levels, and languages. Tweeting, Slacking, and Discording with the extended R community, bringing people together to share, learn and send memes. A unique opportunity to learn something new; a different programming language, a new set of packages, or simply going as fast as possible to the horror of all style guides. Emil hopes to introduce you to a unique learning experience that will bring you as much enjoyment as it has done for him.
