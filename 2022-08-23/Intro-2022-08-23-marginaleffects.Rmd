# I fit a model... now what?

#### Speaker: **Vincent Arel-Bundock**

Vincent Arel-Bundock is an Associate Professor of Political Science at the Université de Montréal, where he teaches research methods and political economy. He uploaded his first R package to CRAN in 2009. 13 years later, he is still fielding support emails and bug reports.

#### Abstract

This talk introduces `marginaleffects`, a unified interface to interpret the results of over 60 classes of models in `R`. `marginaleffects` allows users to compute and plot the key quantities of interest in most statistical analyses: predictions, contrasts, marginal effects (slopes), and marginal means. In addition, users can easily conduct hypothesis tests for arbitrary functions of a model's parameters.

`marginaleffects` is fast, low-dependency, actively developed, and well documented. The package website hosts an extensive list of vignettes and case studies which illustrate how to interpret and report the results of a variety of models: Bayesian, GAMs, Mixed-Effects, causal inference, etc.
