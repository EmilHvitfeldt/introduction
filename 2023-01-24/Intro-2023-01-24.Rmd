# Upcoming Events

### 1/31 - [Advanced Probabilistic ML Book Reading Group](https://www.meetup.com/socal-rug/events/290821300/)

Kevin Murphy is putting the finishing touches on his new two-book series on probabilistic machine learning. This group will meet weekly on Tuesdays to discuss the second book titled [Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics (pre-release copy here)](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html).

This will be an advanced book reading group discussing topics such as variational inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, state-space models, and diffusion generative models. The plan for this series is to read Parts I and II, covering Fundamentals and Inference through the spring. Other series will follow for the remainder of the book. For more information, please read [this document about the format and logistics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q4m_bMqT293W827hwFur6D-EEdgvSj9baJqcEDJZwus/edit).

Participants are asked to do the reading prior to each session, and also to take turns helping lead the weekly discussions. If you are interested in participating in the book reading group but are unable to attend this first session, please message Ted Kyi, the meeting organizer.

# Upcoming Events (continued)

### 2/11 - [Introduction to Stochastic Processes](https://www.meetup.com/socal-rug/events/290969003/)

SIGN UP ON [EVENTBRITE](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/socal-rug-introduction-to-stochastic-processes-tickets-515333254637)

In this full-day workshop at [UC Irvine's Paul Merage School of Business SB1 Room 2100](https://goo.gl/maps/Q5en7Gnig2YRm9gL6), we will talk about a variety of stochastic process models, give their definitions. We will discuss the underlying assumptions and theory for the models. Then we will then explore what types of problems they solve for and practical applications where they are used. This course will cover the following stochastic process models, Markov Chain, Random Walk, Poisson Process, Birth-and-Death Process, Branching Process, and Brownian Motion.

The workshop is designed to be hands-on. Participants are required to bring laptops and be ready to write R, analyze data and interpret results. For each model, we present an example with a complete R code, and then an exercise to work on. Workshop participants do not need to be experts in R, the exercises generally require you to run a few functions that are given in the example problem.

The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book [Stochastic Processes with R, CRC Press, 2022](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PVF4X8C).

### 2/21 - BACK TO IN PERSON MEETINGS!!!

MEETUP SIGN UP COMING SOON

We're thrilled to announce the kickoff of our in-person meetings after a long hiatus. More details to follow but below are the key details:
* **Where?** PeopleSpace, [1691 Kettering St, Irvine, CA 92614](https://goo.gl/maps/ELgWFs6JMhQfjfwy9)
* **When?** Tuesday, Feb 21, 6:30-8:30pm PST
* **Why?** As if free food wasn't enough, SoCal RUG's own [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://www.emilhvitfeldt.com/) will be providing a refresher and overview of the recently released {[purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/)} v1.0.0 for working with functions and vectors. Emil is a Software Engineer at Posit on the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) team.

# Building R Packages on Easy Mode

#### Speaker: **Dave Gruenewald**
[Dave Gruenewald](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgruenew/) works at Posit (formerly RStudio) as a manager for Solutions Engineering. His current focus is helping businesses configure and administer the professional products from Posit. He resides in Chicago, IL, and can talk for hours about music, movies, or bees.

Do you have scattered R scripts recycled across projects? Have you had a simple R Markdown that escalated into a full suite of dashboards and reports? Do you look at old code you wrote and wonder what the heck you were trying to do? While there are obviously lots of benefits to packaging up your R code, creating your first R package is much easier than you may think.

In this session, we will create a working R package from scratch. We'll build and review a basic package skeleton with the help of the {[devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/)} package. Next, we'll showcase some best practices and iterative workflows around documentation and testing our new R package. Finally, we will also incorporate package data, vignettes, and a website with {[pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/)}.
