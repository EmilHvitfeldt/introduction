# Reducing Emergency Department Overutilization

#### Speaker: **Luke Morris**
[Luke Morris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukesmorris/) is the Business Data Analyst for the Ruth and Harry Roman Emergency Department at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

Before working in healthcare, Luke was a journalist for a decade, working for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, The Dallas Morning News, and, regrettably, Sinclair Broadcast Group for a few months.

He has a bachelor’s degree in Journalism from Kansas, a master’s in Business Analytics from Merrimack College, and just completed a master’s in Health Delivery Science at Cedars-Sinai’s Graduate School for Biomedical Sciences, during which his capstone examined unconscious bias in physician treatment notes using NLP via tidymodels.
